                                In order to play, you need to have Bits in your account.<br>
                                Obtain Bits by purchasing through us or exchanging your Bitcoin/Ethereum. Once Bits are obtained, you are ready to play the game. Place your preferred amount of Bits before the end of the 5 second countdown. As the multiplier increases, you can choose at any time to exit, and turn a profit. You lose your placed Bits if multiplier "Busts" before you exit.<br>
                                Note: Multiplier begins increasing from 1x value.<br>

                                 What Is Extra Bet?
                            </b>
                            <p>
                                Extra Bet is to hedge against the multiplier result being 0. Due to the randomness of the result, it is unknown when and what the multiplier result is, when 0 result will appear and how often it appears. Extra Bet hedges against this as you as a player are allowed to place a small amount to recover your loses in the event multiplier result is 0.

                            <p>
                                A "Bit" is equivalent to a 100 for each US dollar. The amount of “Bits” you receive when exchanging Bitcoin/Ethereum depends on the set exchange rates. Exchange rates maybe different everyday according to market supply and demand and is subject to market fluctuations.<br>
                                At the current time of writing, one Bitcoin is worth USD9,330 and Etherum is worth USD727. If you exchange your Bitcoin/Ethereum you will obtain 9,300,000 Bits and 72,000 Bits, according to current value.

                                What about internet lag?

                                Madabit is real-time based platform and relies on good internet network interaction to produce up to date results. We have implemented state-of-the-art servers to handle platform traffic and gaming data processing to ensure smooth operations and have a highly trained team of specialist working around the clock to maintain it. We highly recommend that users check their internet connections and hardware before participating in the games in order to reduce issues pertaining to lags.<br>
                                Certain regions in the world have less advanced internet connection infrastructure and users from those regions may experience certain amounts of lags. In order to allow users from these regions an opportunity to enjoy the gameplay, we have implemented an “auto cashout” feature. This feature, once implemented by the user, guarantees that regardless of lags, once the preset multiplier has reached its target, the user will automatically cashout accordingly. This feature interacts with our servers and informs our servers that the user wishes to exit and turn a profit at X multiplier, thus guaranteeing that even if the user has lost internet connection, his gameplay will still be completed.<br>
                                Eg. User sets profit exit @ multiplier at x2.0<br>
                                Once multiplier has hit x2.0, user is automatically cashed out.<br>
                                A certain amount of lag exists in between servers and users. Our dedicated team ensures that it is as long as possible (currently below 0.3ms) for data processing and gameplay. We would still highly advise users to use the cashout feature if they intend to play for long hours.<br>
                                We will not be held liable if an error or lag occurs due to end user having low internet quality and/or lacking in hardware or hardware malfunction.

                                Upon detection that you have disconnected from the game while on-going, we will attempt to cash you out.<br>
                                If you realize that you have weak internet connection, we highly advise on using our Auto Cashout feature to safeguard your Bits.<br>
                                There will be no dispute and we will have the final decision of outcome if it has been determined that a disconnection happened due to failure from player’s side to ensure connectivity.

                                A safeguard for the company has been placed in the event a certain player is profiting more than 0.5% of the total gaming pool amount in a single round, or total active players profiting more than 3% of the total gaming pool amount in a single round. This ensures that players are guaranteed their winnings and the gaming pool does not fall into negative balance.<br>
                                Another situation which may cause players being forced out would be due to unforeseen circumstances such as natural disaster or server failure.<br>

                                How high can the multiplier go?
                            </b>
                            <p>
                                There are no limitations to the multiplier as long as a single player does not profit exceeding 0.5% of the total gaming pool amount or total active players profiting more than 3% of the total gaming pool amount per single round. As far as Bits earning goes, the sky is the limit.
